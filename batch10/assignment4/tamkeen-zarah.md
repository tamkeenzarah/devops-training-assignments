## Describe Architecture of Kubernetes 

An opensource containerization tool

Kubernetes Architecture has following components:

### - Master nodes
### - Worker nodes

Master Node has further following componets:

### - API Server

    - Responsible for all the tasks to run on a Kubernetes cluster


### - Scheduler

    - Schedules the tasks to slave node in the form of pods and services

### - Controller Manager

    - Manages the Kubernetes cluster
    - Matches the current sate with desired state  

### - ETCD

    - The database which stores all the key values of a cluster
    
Worker Node has further following componets:

### Container runtime

  - To run and manage containers on the worker node

### Kubelet

  - An agent which communicates with the Master node and executes on worker nodes
  - Ensures if the containers on Pod are running and healthy

### Kube-proxy

  - runs on each node
  - ensure that the services are available
  - kube-proxy sets up the routes

### Pods
  - one or more containers that logically go together. Pods run on nodes. Pods run together as a logical unit. So they have the same shared content. They all share the same IP address but can reach other Pods via localhost, as well as shared storage. Pods donâ€™t need to all run on the same machine as containers can span more than one machine. One node can run multiple pods.
